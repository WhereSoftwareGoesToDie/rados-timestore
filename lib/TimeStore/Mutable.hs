-- | This module provides an abstraction on top of the "regular" TimeStore API
-- to provide "mutability" by viewing a stored piece of data as a series of
-- updates. There is no time associated with these blobs of data, the time
-- becomes a sequence number behind the scenes.
--
-- This module is intended to be imported qualified.
